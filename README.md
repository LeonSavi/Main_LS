# Leonardo Saviane Git

Dear viewer,

This is my personal Git repository where I will store the codes I used during my work experience or on topics in which I am particularly interested, such as:
- Data Analytics/Science:
  - Functions
  - Network Analysis
  - Machine Learning
  - NLP
- Exercises
- Game development

I hope this repository can be helpful to you and provide insight into my coding style.

Best,

Leonardo

P.S. Over time, some of the codes might become outdated and may no longer reflect my current coding style.
